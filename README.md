# ClueHelper
This is a program designed to aid someone playing the board game clue.
This program takes as inputs, each rumor, who shows a card, who passes,
what the card is when you are shown it and from these will compute with
progressively more rumors what each player has in their hands. This program
uses an algorithm that can be used without an computer by a player, but is more 
powerful in that it can reference prior rumors which most people do not have
the memory capacity for.
